	"richTextDescription": "Summer 2021 has finally arrived. For months, I've been cooped up inside my apartment like a sickly Chihuahua.  \nThanks to high vaccination rates, NYC is opening back up, which means I get to hit the town and show the world my freshest summer fit.\n\n\nWhat exactly is my summer fit? Well, thankfully, I have the power of knowledge graph entity relationships, streams, and sites to show you.\n\n\nShoes: I'll be rocking the Lightning McQueen limited edition crocs. They're comfortable and swaggy to the extreme. Not to mention, I can put them in all\\-wheel\\-drive mode for maximum speed (AWD mode is when you have the pivoting croc heel strap behind your ankle). Easy. Next.  \nBottom: My pants choice is the Hank Willis patchwork twill shorts. I am eager to show off my California redwood tree\\-trunk legs in these bad boys.  \nTop: I'm going with the \"I like fairytales\" shirt. It looks like strawberry haagen dazs ice cream.",
